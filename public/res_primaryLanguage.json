When faced with a [frustrating] coding problem I will allow myself five minutes to search on the internet for an answer, I will view the websites codepen, w3schools and/or developer.mozilla.org to help solve my problem. Moreover, if my problem still persists after the time limit, I will ask on Discord (we used our own Discord channel at both Tech Educators and Netmatters) or I will ask (one of the staff available) in person.
